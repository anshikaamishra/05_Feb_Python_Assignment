    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. It allows the class to control access to its internal state and provides data hiding, protecting the attributes from direct external manipulation. Encapsulation helps maintain data integrity and promotes secure and organized code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding unnecessary implementation details of a class and exposing only the essential features and behavior to the outside world. It allows us to create simplified and manageable representations of real-world objects or concepts. Abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which provide a blueprint for derived classes and ensure adherence to a certain interface or structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where a class (subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass or base class). It allows the reuse of code and enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where derived classes inherit properties and behaviors from their parent classes. Inheritance promotes code reusability and supports the concept of \"is-a\" relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism means the ability of a method to take on multiple forms. It allows a class to provide a single interface for different data types or objects. In Python, polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. Polymorphism enables code flexibility and dynamic behavior, making it easier to work with different objects using a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars form the foundation of object-oriented programming paradigms and provide a powerful way to design and implement software systems with modularity, reusability, and maintainability in mind."

    "- The `__init__()` function in Python is a special method that serves as the constructor for a class. It is automatically called when an object of the class is created. The primary purpose of the `__init__()` method is to initialize the attributes (data) of the object with values provided during object creation. It allows you to set up the initial state of the object when it is instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `__init__()` method is optional, but it is commonly used to ensure that all necessary attributes are properly initialized at the time of object creation. Without the `__init__()` method, you would have to manually set each attribute after creating the object, which could lead to errors if some attributes are missed or incorrectly initialized.\n",

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), `self` is a convention used as the first parameter in instance methods of a class. It represents the instance of the class itself and allows instance methods to access and operate on the attributes and methods of that particular instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of `self` in OOP is essential for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instance Scope: When a method is called on an object, `self` refers to that specific instance of the class. It allows methods to access and manipulate the instance's attributes (data) and call other instance methods within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Attribute Access: Using `self` as a reference, methods can access and modify the object's attributes. Without `self`, Python would consider the variable as a local variable within the method, and it wouldn't have any connection to the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Method Invocation: When calling an instance method, Python automatically passes the object on which the method is called as the first argument (`self`). This is why we only provide the arguments after `self` in the method definition, and Python handles the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
